### Git Commit Messages

Summarised from How to Write a Git Commit Message

1. You can write more detailed commit messages using the command git commit -m <title> -m <description>. However, most commits should be short and concise (see this guy's commit history for inspiration). General rule of thumb is to limit subject lines and/or single-line commits to 50 characters.
2. Capitalise the subject line.
3. Do not end the subject line with a full stop.
4. Use the "imperative mood" in the subject line (written as if you're giving a command). e.g. Merge branch 'myfeature', Remove deprecated methods, Update getting started documentation and NOT Changing behavior of urls() function.
